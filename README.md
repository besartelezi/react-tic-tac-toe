# React: Raspberry Extract And Chocolate Toppings
One of the assignments given to us by BeCode was to create a lil' Kahoot app of our own using React.
I read through all the documentation of React and wrote everything down to help me understand it.
But I'm not the type of person to just learn by reading, I need to make my hands dirty and work on something if I want to really understand and learn it.

As I was reading through the React documentation, I stumbled upon [this cool link!](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
The official React documentation gave us a guide on how to get started on React by making a tic-tac-toe game.
So that's what I'm going to do before working any further on the personalized Kahoot/Quiz app.

This might not be the most optimal way to do it, but I do not care.
If finishing this tic-tac-toe game will help me understand React on a more **FUN**demental level, then it won't matter how much time I spend on this.

I still intend to finish the Kahoot/Quiz app, but right now, I'd rather learn how to create something properly with React than to finish the app without really understanding how it works.

I also won't be documenting everything regarding this tic-tact-toe app, since the documentation for is it available on the React website.
